# Dart's Part Of Speech (POS) in Dart Programming

Understanding these fundamental concepts is essential for writing effective Dart code.
- comments
- keywords
- operators
- Values and datas
- expressions


## Concepts

1. **Comments:**
   - *Definition:* Comments in Dart are used to provide explanatory notes within the code. They are ignored by the Dart compiler and serve as documentation or annotations.
   - *Example:*
     ```dart
     // This is a single-line comment
     
     /*
     This is a
     multi-line comment
     ```

2. **Keywords:**
   - *Definition:* Keywords are reserved words in Dart that have specific meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable or function names).
   - *Examples:* `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `class`, `return`, `new`, `var`, `final`, etc.

3. **Operators:**
   - *Definition:* Operators perform operations on variables and values. Dart supports various types of operators, including arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and others.
   - *Examples:*
     ```dart
     // Arithmetic operators
     int sum = 3 + 5;
     int difference = 8 - 3;
     double product = 4.0 * 2.5;
     double quotient = 10 / 2;
     
     // Relational operators
     bool isEqual = (5 == 5);
     bool isNotEqual = (3 != 7);
     
     // Logical operators
     bool andResult = true && false;
     bool orResult = true || false;
     
     // Assignment operators
     int x = 10;
     x += 5; // Equivalent to x = x + 5
     ```

4. **Values and Data:**
   - *Definition:* Values and data in Dart refer to the various types of information that can be stored in variables. Dart is a statically typed language, so variables have specific data types.
   - *Examples:*
     ```dart
     int age = 25;           // Integer value
     double height = 5.9;    // Double (floating-point) value
     String name = 'John';   // String value
     bool isStudent = true;  // Boolean value
     ```

5. **Expressions:**
   - *Definition:* Expressions in Dart are combinations of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result.
   - *Examples:*
     ```dart
     int result = (3 * 5) + (8 / 2);  // Arithmetic expression
     
     bool isAdult = (age >= 18);      // Relational expression
     
     String greeting = 'Hello, ' + name + '!';  // String concatenation expression
     ```

## Summary

#### Comments provide clarity and documentation 
#### keywords control the structure and flow of the code
#### operators perform operations 
#### values and data represent information 
#### expressions combine elements to produce results.
