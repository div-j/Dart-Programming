### Dart Classes:

In Dart, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of a class, and they encapsulate data and behavior. Here's a simple example of a Dart class:

```dart
// Define a class named 'Person'
class Person {
  // Fields or properties
  String name;
  int age;

  // Constructor
  Person(this.name, this.age);

  // Methods
  void introduceYourself() {
    print('Hello, I am $name, and I am $age years old.');
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the 'Person' class
void main() {
  var person = Person('John', 25);
  person.introduceYourself();
}
```

Let's break down the components of this example:

1. **Class Declaration (`class Person`):**
   - `class` keyword is used to declare a class.
   - `Person` is the name of the class.

2. **Fields or Properties:**
   - Inside the class, you can define fields or properties to represent data.
   - In our example, `name` and `age` are fields.

3. **Constructor:**
   - The `Person` class has a constructor, which is a special method called when an object is created.
   - The `this.name` and `this.age` in the constructor initialize the fields with the values passed during object creation.

4. **Methods:**
   - Methods define the behavior of the class.
   - `introduceYourself` is a method that prints a message introducing the person.

5. **Creating an Instance:**
   - In the `main` function, we create an instance of the `Person` class using the `var person = Person('John', 25);` statement.

6. **Accessing Methods and Properties:**
   - We call the `introduceYourself` method on the `person` object using `person.introduceYourself();`.
